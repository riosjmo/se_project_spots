Social Media/Image Sharing Site

# Description:

The project is a social media type of website that has many different features and functionalities. In the Profile, it shows the profile avatar (Bessie Coleman) and her title. There is also an edit profile button and a new post button. After the profile it has the users posts, including a cafe, a mountain house, a bridge, etc. At the end there is a simple footer with a copyright symbol and the year.
